# Stable Diffusion Model for Face Generation

This repository contains a project implementing a Stable Diffusion model for generating high-quality, realistic facial images. The project explores the application of diffusion models to generate diverse and photorealistic faces, suitable for tasks like artistic creations, synthetic data generation, and research in generative AI.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- Implementation of the Stable Diffusion algorithm for face generation.
- Pretrained model fine-tuned for face-specific tasks.
- Customizable parameters to control image diversity and quality.
- Support for generating images of specified resolutions.
- Efficient performance on GPU-enabled setups for real-time generation.
